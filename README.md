# Schema-Armadillo

## Hate writing Mongoose schemas? Schema-Armadillo is here for you!
With our easy-to-use model, you can design your own schema and watch them transform into Mongoose syntax!

## You can now SAVE your schema!
Make a really nice schema and want to refer back to it in the future? Log in and save it for later!

## But how do I log in?
If you already have an account with us, simply click the `Login` button at the top-right corner of your screen!
If you don't already have an account with us, either click the `Signup` button (also at the top-right corner of your screen) OR `Save` your schema at the bottom of the form to be redirected
**DON'T WORRY** Your schema will be saved and you'll find it in your new account once you've finished signing up!

## But how do I get an account?
Schema-Armadillo now supports **THREE** different methods for signup!
You can:
1) Create an account with us
2) Sign up with GitHub
3) Sign up with Google

## What else can I do with Schema-Armadillo?
Our Mongoose code snippets (created when you click `Create Schema`) are copied on click! (That's right, no click and drag, copy paste, business)
